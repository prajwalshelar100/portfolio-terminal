OBJECTIVE

Create a next-generation personal portfolio that feels like:
• A playable sci-fi control interface
• A game menu for a systems engineer
• A digital research universe
• A living AI-core dashboard

Target reaction:
“This feels like a game engine, not a portfolio website.”


3D WORLD STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)

Design the portfolio as a navigable 3D environment such as:
• A neural command center
• A futuristic systems observatory
• A digital AI core floating in space

Semantic Mapping:
• Identity → Central core labeled “Java Systems Engineer”
• Java Skills → Heavy industrial modules / reactor-like structures
• Spring & Backend → Data pipelines flowing between nodes
• IMD Rainfall Analyzer → Living rainfall simulation + data streams
• Computer Vision → Camera lenses & scanning shaders
• Research & Patent → Expanding procedural graphs
• Contact → Signal beacon / transmission console


GAME-LEVEL INTERACTION REQUIREMENTS

• Mouse controls depth, parallax, lighting
• Scroll acts as camera movement
• Hover triggers micro-physics
• Clicks have inertia and resistance
• Keyboard unlocks:
  – Developer mode
  – Debug overlays
  – Hidden research layers

Physics Rules:
• Spring-based motion only
• Momentum, drag, friction, gravity
• Magnetic attraction and repulsion
• Collision, ripple, deformation effects


CINEMATIC & GPU EFFECTS (MANDATORY)

• Real-time lighting
• Dynamic shadows
• Bloom & glow
• Depth of field
• Motion blur
• Particle systems
• Fog & volumetrics
• Energy waves
• Procedural noise-driven animation


RENDERING STACK

• WebGL / WebGPU
• Three.js or equivalent
• Custom shaders
• Camera paths instead of scrolling
• Interactive 3D typography
• Morphing geometry
• Shader-based materials


UI / UX PHILOSOPHY

• No navbar
• No visible sections
• Exploration-based navigation
• Contextual information
• Progressive disclosure
• Hidden depth for engineers


PERFORMANCE RULES

• Smooth frame rates
• Graceful degradation
• Mobile = simplified but still immersive
• Never freeze
• Never stutter


WOW MOMENTS (MANDATORY)

• 3 “how is this running in a browser?” moments
• 1 hidden interaction
• 1 impossible cinematic transition
• 1 emotional system reaction


FINAL COMMAND

Do NOT be safe
Do NOT be minimal
Do NOT be corporate

Design like:
• A game studio
• A systems research lab
• A future-tech prototype
• A digital art installation

Push limits.
Break conventions.
Make the browser sweat.
